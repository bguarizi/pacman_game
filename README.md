# PACMAN GAME

This game was created during a college classe about Computer Architecture, this was our finish project in the class.
For this, I had to use the programming language Assembly, and a simulator named P3SIM. With this, I could program and visualize the pacman game.
The graphical interface isn't very advanced, but I was able to apply the concepts learned in this class, and do a funny and dynamic game.

## The game

- The pacman have three lifes.
- The pacman is represented by "$"
- The ghosts are represented by "&"
- If pacman meet any ghost in your way, it lost one life.
- If pacman get the "+", it receive +100 points.
- The game is just finish when pacman eat all of your food.

When I was doing this game, I could learn concepts about the main components of a computer: CPU, I/O devices, and memory. Could see how they work together; interruptions; types of memory; and more.
